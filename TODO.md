# TODO
## Editor
- Show some info on mouse over of blocks
- Fast scrolling when zoomed out

## Rendering
- Culling
- Unify glow on / glow off calls
- Don't use `from_euler_angles` so much

## Gameplay
- Campaign mode

## Level Ideas
### Introductory
- Append orange
- Flip color
- Even/odd

### Intermediate
- Splitting input into two outputs
- Something about buffering?

### Hard

## Other
- Revise `TickTime`, manipulating it is needlessly tedious
