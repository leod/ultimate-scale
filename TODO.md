# TODO
## Movement
- Turn faster on shift
- Shame pulsator for crossing

## Editor
- Select all
- Not allowing deletion of `Block::Input` and `Block::Output`
- Make `Mode::PipeTool` handle situations around connective blocks better
- Show some info on mouse over of blocks
- Better handling of multi-layer editing
    - For example, don't move grid on Z, but show a smaller grid on top

## Execution
- Define deterministic priorities when spawning blips

## Rendering
- Render block inputs
- Check if it's okay to rely on `glutin::dpi::LogicalSize` for texture sizes

## Gameplay
- Campaign mode

## Level Ideas
### Introductory
- Append orange
- Flip color
- Even/odd

### Intermediate
- Splitting input into two outputs
- Something about buffering?

### Hard
