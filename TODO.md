# TODO
## Editor
- Show some info on mouse over of blocks
- Fast scrolling when zoomed out
- Fix undo when extending pipes
- No red outline when placing same object
- Smooth camera movement

## Rendering
- Highlight wind-wind interactions
- Improve pillars

## Gameplay
- Campaign mode

## Optimization
- Figure out a way to use pareen without boxes
- Render outlines as boxes instead of 12 lines
- See if we need triple-buffering for update/draw threading
- Some cheap culling heuristic
- Don't use `from_euler_angles` for axis-aligned stuff
- Particle rendering without geometry shaders
- Wind LoD
- Better streaming of instance and particle data?

## Sound
 - _Anything at all_!

## Level Ideas
### Introductory
- Append orange
- Flip color
- Even/odd

### Intermediate
- Splitting input into two outputs
- Something about buffering?

### Hard

## Other
- Revise `TickTime`, manipulating it is needlessly tedious
